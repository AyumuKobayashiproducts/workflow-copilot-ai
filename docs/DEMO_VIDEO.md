## Demo video

This project already has a live demo and E2E coverage; a short demo video helps reviewers understand it in under a minute.

### Recommended format (60–90s)

1) Home (30-second demo steps)
2) Breakdown: goal → add/generate steps → save to Inbox
3) Inbox: add/edit/complete one task
4) Weekly: generate/save report → (optional) Slack post
5) Settings: show RBAC + activity feed (audit log)

### Recording tips

- Use a clean browser profile (no extensions popups).
- Keep it fast: do not explain every click; show the loop end-to-end.
- Add captions or a short voice-over.

### Where to publish

- Upload to YouTube (unlisted) or Loom.
- Add the link to README “Quick links” once uploaded.
