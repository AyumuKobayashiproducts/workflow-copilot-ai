# Roadmap

This is a portfolio project roadmap (what I would build next to make it a sellable SaaS).

## Near-term (1–2 weeks)

- Self-serve data deletion (delete tasks/weekly content) from Settings
- Basic rate limiting for write endpoints
- Better onboarding and “first run” experience without demo flags

## Mid-term (1–2 months)

- Team workspaces (multi-user, shared weekly review, role-based access)
- Billing (Stripe) + plans (Free / Pro / Team)
- Activity feed + weekly digest scheduling

## Longer-term

- Integrations beyond Slack (Notion/Jira/Linear)
- Analytics and insights (completion rate, cycle time, focus adherence)
