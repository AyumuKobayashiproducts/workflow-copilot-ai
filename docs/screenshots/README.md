## Screenshots

This directory is the target output for the Playwright screenshots config.

Generate (English UI) screenshots locally:

```bash
npm run screenshots
```

Expected outputs:

- `home.png`
- `inbox.png`
- `weekly.png`

If you want to commit screenshots, add them as normal image files in this directory.
